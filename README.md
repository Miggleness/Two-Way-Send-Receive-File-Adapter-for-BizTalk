Two-Way Send Receive File WCF Adapter for BizTalk - mock WCF BizTalk adapters

Mock WCF-based send-receive BizTalk adapters by streaming out the request message to a file and streaming in the response from an XML file.

Much thanks to http://synthesisconsulting.net/blog/2012/5/17/biztalk-wcf-loopback-binding.html

This project originated as a way to mock the SAP-WCF adapters since our developers do not have access to the SAP server.
